### Package usage

[Vuetify] is used for the UI components because of usage familiarity from my previous work
[VueKonva] is used for the canvas and its built-in integration with vue
[Pinia] is used for state management because of its simplicity
[TailwindCSS] is used for styling because it's a well known css framework
