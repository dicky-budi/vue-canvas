# vue-canvas

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Package usage

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#installation) is used for the UI components because of usage familiarity from my previous work with VueJS\
[VueKonva](https://konvajs.org/docs/vue/index.html) is used for the canvas and it has own library integrated with vue\
[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html) is used for state management because its recommended by default in Vue CLI when initiating VueJS Project\
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) is used for styling because of its well known css framework\

## Design layout

Heavily focused on canvas container, by filling 2 / 3 of the screen width and the rest of 1/3 screen width is used for the data input and history input

## Folder Structure

The same with initial boilerplate when using VueJS + Vite + Pinia + TailwindCSS
